Within my first 3 months, I designed and developed a test automation framework solution, resulting in a 95% reduction in testing and deployment time and saving over $10k in monthly cost previously spent on external tools. Collaborating with cross-functional teams, I contributed to the development and testing of various in-house React applications in both JavaScript and TypeScript, as well as backend APIs in NodeJS and C#. These projects included solutions for credit analysis, real-time presentations, and interactive voice response systems.",
